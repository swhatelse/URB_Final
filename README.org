  And then the execute the following script which will install GLib.
  It will also compile the Uniform Reliable Broadcast program.
  #+begin_src sh :session foo :results output :exports both 
  . ./install.sh
  #+end_src
* Compiling the program alone
  #+begin_src sh :session foo :results output :exports both 
  ./compile.sh
  #+end_src
* Usage
  To automatically run 4 instances:
  #+begin_src sh :session foo :results output :exports both 
  ./run.sh
  #+end_src
  Or to run instances independently
  #+begin_src sh :session foo :results output :exports both 
  ./bin/main -p [port number] -f host.txt
  #+end_src
